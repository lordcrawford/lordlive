                Hey, I'm Lord. I'm an African American born and raised in New York City. I've been titled many things â€” 
                a product manager, programmer, designer, analyst, artist, etc. At my core, I'd 
                say I'm a creative architect and student of the world. I created this website as a space for my thoughts and passions to intermingle, 
                I hope it inspires others to create their own spaces.

                Currently, I'm a Product Manager at The New York Times leading the advertising experience on NYT Games (think Wordle...) and NYT Cooking.
                In 2022, I graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Computer Science and focus on Human-Computer Interaction. 
                <br/><br/> 

                My professional expertise lies in product management, creative web design/development, and
                human-centered design. Outside of this, I can build 3D AR & VR applications, draw using charcoal,
                ink, and pencil mediums, and produce electronic music.
