                Hey, I'm Lord. I created this website as a space for my passions to intermingle, 
                I hope it inspires others to create a space for their thoughts to live. I'm an 
                African American born and raised in New York City. I've been titled many things â€” 
                a product manager, programmer, designer, analyst, artist, etc. At my core, I'd 
                say a creative architect and student of the world.

                Currently, I'm a Product Manager at The New York Times. In 2022, I graduated from 
                Columbia University with a degree in Computer Science and focus on Human-Computer Interaction.
                <br/><br/> 

                <span>My professional expertise lies in product management, product consulting, creative web design/development, and
                human-centered design.</span> Outside of this, I can build 3D AR & VR applications, draw using charcoal,
                ink, and pencil mediums, and produce electronic music.
