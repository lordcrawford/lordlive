                    Hey, I'm Lord. I created this website as a space for my passions to intermingle, 
                    I hope it inspires others to create a space for their thoughts to live. I'm an 
                    African American born and raised in New York City. I've been titled many things â€” 
                    a product manager, programmer, designer, analyst, artist, etc. At my core, I'd 
                    say a creative architect and student of the world.

                    Currently, I'm a Product Manager at The New York Times. In 2022, I graduated from 
                    Columbia University with a degree in Computer Science and focus on Human-Computer Interaction.
