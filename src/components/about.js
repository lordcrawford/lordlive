                Hey I'm Lord. I'm an African American male born and raised in New York City. I like to create a lot of random things 
                including this website which lives as a space for my projects, thoughts, and past lives. I hope it 
                serves as an inspiration for anyone reading this to also create a space for your thoughts to live.
            </h1> <br></br>

                In my professional life, I'm a Product Manager at the New York Times. Ironically enough, 
                I don't have much writing to show but this is changing :D. At the Times, I work closely
                with Advertising, Games (think wordle, crossword, spelling bee), and the Cooking App.
                <br/><br/>

                I love to tinker with websites, sketch (ink/charcoal mostly), produce music, and any random
                design projects that come up. Feel free to click around and get lost in my creations.<br/><br/>
