                Hey, I'm Lord. I'm an African American born and raised in New York City. <br/><br/> 

                I've been titled many things â€” a product manager, programmer, designer, analyst,
                 artist, etc. At my core, I'd say a creative architect and student of the world. 
                <br/><br/> 

                Currently, I'm a Product Manager at The New York Times. In 2022, I graduated from 
                Columbia University with a degree in Computer Science and focus on Human-Computer Interaction.
                <br/><br/> 

                My speciality lies in product management, product consulting, creative web design & development, and
                human-centered design. Outside of this, I can build 3D AR & VR applications, draw using charcoal,
                ink, and pencil mediums, and produce electronic music.
